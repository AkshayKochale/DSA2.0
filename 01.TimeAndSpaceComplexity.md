# Time and Space complexity


## Time Complexity

- Not time require for algorithm to run for N size input

- **why?** As we run our algorithm on different machine, performance of algrithm cannot be decide as powerful machine will run it faster than normal machine, hence **Time Complexity** is unit to measure

- In other words, How time will change when input size is changed(lower or higher)

- Basically time complexity is calculated into 3 main categories of input (best,avarage,worst)

- best is denoted as 'Ω' ,avarage 'θ'as and worst as 'O'

- Mostly we consider worst case (Big O) as it repressent worst case and for real time use it better to consider what worst max time complexity will be for alogrithm instead of best or happy case


## Space Complexity

- Similarly how space will change with change in input

- Here are also 3 categories ,with same notations

- Not space taken by algorithm to run, but the realtion of space when input size is changed(lower or higher)



## What are different Time and Space complexity


| Complexity     | Name          | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **O(1)**       | Constant      | Execution time/space does not depend on input size. |
| **O(log N)**   | Logarithmic   | time/space grows slowly as input increases (e.g., binary search). |
| **O(N)**       | Linear        | time/space grows directly with input size. |
| **O(N log N)** | Linearithmic  | Common in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort. |
| **O(N²)**      | Quadratic     | time/space grows with square of input size (e.g., nested loops). |
| **O(N³)**      | Cubic         | Triple nested loops, often in matrix operations. |
| **O(2ⁿ)**      | Exponential   | time/space doubles with each additional input (e.g., recursive Fibonacci). |
| **O(N!)**      | Factorial     | Extremely slow, used in brute-force permutations (e.g., traveling salesman). |



## Tricks 

- Avoid TLE(Time Limit Exceeded) - Most of the machine today perform 10^8 max operation per second,our code must execute in less than this time or we will get TLE error

- Must use following table to avoid TLE, always check constraint in given problem and then try to find out what solution will be accepted

- Also gives idea about which pattern will work based on contraints

| Input Size (N) | Acceptable Time Complexity |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| ≤ 10           | O(N!), O(2ⁿ)               |
| ≤ 20           | O(2ⁿ)                      |
| ≤ 100          | O(N³)                      |
| ≤ 1,000        | O(N²)                      |
| ≤ 10⁵          | O(N log N)                 |
| ≤ 10⁶          | O(N), O(log N)             |
| ≥ 10⁷ to 10⁸   | O(N), O(log N)             |
| ≥ 10⁹          | O(log N), O(1)             |
